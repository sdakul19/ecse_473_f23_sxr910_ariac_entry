# How to use ariac_entry package

## How the package works
The ariac_entry package is a slightly edited version of the 2019 ARIAC competition. Aside from minor customizations, all components remain the same.
This includes messages, services, order parts, etc. The documentation from the competition can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/ariac/wiki/2019/documentation).

Within the package is a launch directory, msg directory, src directory, as well as the CMakeList and package file.

### Launch
The launch directory contains the launch file which launches the [ecse_373_ariac](https://github.com/cwru-eecs-373/ecse_373_ariac/tree/noetic-devel/ecse_373_ariac) launch file. <br>
It also launches the ariac_entry node using the ariac_entry source code.

### Msg
The message directory contains two messages, Bin.msg and Bins.msg. 

#### Bin.msg
Bin.msg has three elements.
```
# Bin name
string bin_name

# Material type
string material_type

# Camera Image Information
osrf_gear/LogicalCameraImage image
```
For bins 1 through bin 6, each bin will be identified by their bin number, material_type, and the image data. The current environment has bins 1-3 empty so their material_type is listed as any and there is no image data. Bin 4 has the piston_rod_part material and currently has 9 parts. The camera image data should contain the pose of each part. Bin 5 has the gasket_part and currently has 6 parts. Bin 6 has the gear_part and currently has 12 parts.

#### Bins.msg
The Bins.msg has only one element which is a vector of bins.
```
# Collection of bins
Bin[] bins
```
The Bins.msg is for publishing to the topic /bins_contents. Currently the bin vector is only initialized once and needs to be modified to update everytime a part is taken out or added to the bins. To see the bin contents: `rostopic echo /bin_contents`

### Src
For this lab certain criterias had to be achieved.
1. Start the competition.
2. Subcribe to Orders topic. Everytime an order is received, use ROS_WARN to print the x, y, and z pose of each part as well as the correct bin location identified by the material_location service.
3. Use material_location service to find the bin of the same type of the first part of the first shipment of the first order.
4. Subscribe to all logical_cameras and store the information.
5. Provide the location of the part in the reference frame of the logical_camera and reference frame of the robot arm1_base_link

#### Start Competition Function Call
In the main function, of ariac_entry.cpp, `start_competition(node)` is run and calls the void function defined earlier in the code. The start_competition function takes in the node as an argument. The function defines a service client `ros::ServiceClient begin_client = node.serviceClient<std_srvs::Trigger>("/ariac/start_competition")` that is triggered by the `/ariac/start_competition` topic. The trigger is instantiated as `std_srvs::Trigger begin_comp`.
When the service is called successfully, the competition will start. Otherwise an error message will print to the screen.

#### Subscribe to Orders Topic
In the main function of ariac_entry.cpp, there is a subscriber subcribed to the `/ariac/Orders` topic and utilizes the `order_callback` function. The subscriber is instantiated as  `ros::Subscriber orders_sub = node.subscribe("/ariac/orders", 10, order_callback)`. The `order_callback` function takes in the `osrf_gear::Order` message and stores the order in a vector. The function also prints to the screen that the order was received and calls the `GetMaterialLocation` service to find the location of each product material type in the order. It also prints out the pose of each product.

#### Use material_location service to find the bin of the first part of the first shipment of the first order.
In the main function of ariac_entry.cpp, there is a function call `get_bin_of_first(node)` in `while(ros::ok())`. This function uses the GetMaterialLocation service to find the bin matched to the material type of the first product of the first shipment of the first order. The service outputs two `storage_units`, one location pointing to the conveyor belt and the other location pointing to the bin. The function contains code that loops through the `storage_units` to output only the bin.

#### Subscribe to all logical cameras and store the information
In the main function of ariac_entry.cpp, there are 10 `logical_camera` subscriber calls. Two of them are subscribing to the `/ariac/logical_camera_agv1` and `/ariac/logical_camera_agv2` topics, six of them are subscribing to the `ariac/logical_camera_bin{n}` topic for bins one through 6, and the last two are subscribing to the `/ariac/quality_control_sensor_1` and `/ariac/quality_control_sensor_2` topics. The functionality of these logical cameras are explained in the 2019 ariac documentation. In each callback, the image data, bin/tray name, and material type are stored in vectors using the bin message type. Currently the data is only stored once and needs to be changed so that the stored data will be updated to each change. If the bin/tray is empty then the material type is named `empty/any` and a warning message is outputted.

#### Provide the location of the part in the reference frame of the logical_camera and reference frame of the robot arm1_base_link
In the main function, `tf2_ros::Buffer` and `tf2_ros::TransformListener` and `tf2::doTransform(part_pose, goal_pose, tfStamped)` to get the locations of bin4 in reference to the arm1_base_link. In the next lab `ik_service` the robot will be programmed to move according to those coordinates.

## Setup Before Launching
### Install Simulation Environment
In order to launch "entry.launch", the simulator environment must be first installed.<br>
For the course of ECSE_473, the simulation environment was cloned from a class repository: [cwru_ariac_2019](https://github.com/cwru-eecs-373/cwru_ariac_2019).
```
# Create a catkin workspace for the simulation environment
mkdir -p ~/ariac_ws/src
cd ~/ariac_ws/src
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cwru-eecs-373/cwru_ariac_2019.git
# Install any missing dependencies
rosdep install --from-paths ariac --ignore-src -r -y
# Build the simulator environment
cd ../
# Install the simulator environment
sudo -- /bin/bash -c "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash; catkin_make
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/noetic install"
```
### Install Working Package for Class Assignment
Along with cwru_ariac_2019, another package, [ecse_373_ariac](https://github.com/cwru-eecs-373/ecse_373_ariac/tree/noetic-devel/ecse_373_ariac), needs to be installed.<br>
Currently the ARIAC Simulation needs to be called from another package.<br>
This package also contains other customizations to fit the course material better.<br>
```
# Make a workspace for the ARIAC node.
mkdir -p ~/ecse_373_ariac_ws/src
cd ~/ecse_373_ariac_ws/src
# Clone the GIT repository for this laboratory.
git clone https://github.com/cwru-eecs-373/ecse_373_ariac.git
# Install any missing dependencies.
rosdep install --from-paths ecse_373_ariac --ignore-src -r -y
# Add it to your ROS environment.
cd ../
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
### empy bug
Ubuntu Focal currently has a bug with the empy module for python3.<br>
There are two solutions for this labratory.<br>

#### Use Static Files in ecse_373_ariac Package
The first method is to use the static files from the ecse_373_ariac package.
This is done by setting the python argument to false.
```
# This is the static file workaround for the Python3 empy module bug in Ubuntu Focal.
roslaunch ecse_373_ariac ecse_373_ariac.launch python:=false
```

#### Direct Patch with Administrative Privileges
The second method is the preferred method to fixing the empy bug.<br>
```
# Path the em.py file of the Python3 empy module.
sudo patch /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/em.py < `rospack find
ecse_373_ariac`/patches/empy.patch
```
## How to Launch
After all necessary packages are installed and ROS is aware of all packages, the launch file should work properly.<br>
```
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch ariac_entry entry.launch
```
